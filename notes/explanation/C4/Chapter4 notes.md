It looks like you're exploring various operators in Project Reactor that allow you to perform side effects or monitor the behavior of reactive sequences without modifying the actual data flow. Hereâ€™s a concise overview of the operators you mentioned, organized by their functionality:

### Side Effects and Notifications

1. **Emissions**:
    - **`doOnNext`**: Execute additional behavior for each emitted item.

2. **Completion**:
    - **`doOnComplete`**: Execute behavior when the sequence completes (for `Flux`).
    - **`doOnSuccess`**: Execute behavior when a `Mono` completes successfully, including the emitted result.

3. **Error Termination**:
    - **`doOnError`**: Execute behavior when an error occurs in the sequence.

4. **Cancellation**:
    - **`doOnCancel`**: Execute behavior when the subscription is canceled.

5. **Start of the Sequence**:
    - **`doFirst`**: Execute behavior at the beginning of the sequence.

6. **Post-Subscription**:
    - **`doOnSubscribe`**: Execute behavior after a subscription is made.

7. **Request Handling**:
    - **`doOnRequest`**: Execute behavior when a request is made to the publisher.

8. **Termination**:
    - **`doOnTerminate`**: Execute behavior when the sequence terminates (either by completion or error).
    - **`doAfterTerminate`**: Execute behavior after termination has been propagated downstream.

9. **Signal Handling**:
    - **`doOnEach`**: Handle any type of signal, represented as a `Signal` object.
    - **`doFinally`**: Execute behavior on any terminating condition (complete, error, cancel).

10. **Logging**:
    - **`log`**: Log internal events and signals occurring in the sequence.

### Monitoring Events

1. **Using Signals**:
    - **`doOnEach`**: Register a callback that will receive notifications for all signals (next, complete, error).
    - **`materialize`**: Converts emitted items into `Signal` objects, capturing the onNext emissions.
    - **`dematerialize`**: Converts `Signal` objects back to their original emissions.

### Example Usage

Here's a simple example demonstrating some of these operators:

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public class ReactorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 10)
            .doOnNext(i -> System.out.println("Processing: " + i))
            .doOnComplete(() -> System.out.println("Completed!"))
            .doOnError(error -> System.out.println("Error: " + error.getMessage()))
            .doOnSubscribe(subscription -> System.out.println("Subscribed!"));

        numbers.subscribe();
    }
}
```

### Summary

These operators provide powerful ways to observe, log, and react to various events occurring in a reactive sequence without altering the actual data flow. You can use them for debugging, side effects, and more complex event handling scenarios. If you have specific questions or want examples of certain operators, feel free to ask!
