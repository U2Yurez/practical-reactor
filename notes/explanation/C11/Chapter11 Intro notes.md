Certainly! If you want to split a `Flux` into multiple streams without using `flatMap`, you have other options depending on what exactly you want to achieve. Below are several methods for splitting a `Flux` without using `flatMap`:

### 1. **Using `window`**

The `window` operator splits a `Flux` into multiple `Flux` instances based on a specified size or time interval. This can be useful for processing chunks of data.

```java
Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 10);

numbers.window(3)
       .subscribe(window -> 
           window.collectList()
                 .subscribe(list -> System.out.println("Window: " + list))
       );
```

Output:
```
Window: [1, 2, 3]
Window: [4, 5, 6]
Window: [7, 8, 9]
Window: [10]
```

### 2. **Using `buffer`**

Similar to `window`, `buffer` collects items into lists based on a specified size or time interval.

```java
Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 10);

numbers.buffer(3)
       .subscribe(list -> System.out.println("Buffer: " + list));
```

Output:
```
Buffer: [1, 2, 3]
Buffer: [4, 5, 6]
Buffer: [7, 8, 9]
Buffer: [10]
```

### 3. **Using `groupBy`**

The `groupBy` operator splits a `Flux` into multiple `Flux` based on a key derived from each element.

```java
Flux<String> words = Flux.just("apple", "banana", "apricot", "blueberry");

words.groupBy(word -> word.startsWith("a") ? "A" : "B")
     .doOnNext(groupedFlux -> 
         groupedFlux.collectList()
                    .subscribe(list -> System.out.println(groupedFlux.key() + ": " + list))
     )
     .subscribe(); // Ensure that the groupedFlux is subscribed
```

Output:
```
A: [apple, apricot]
B: [banana, blueberry]
```

### 4. **Using `filter`**

If you want to split a `Flux` into distinct streams based on conditions, you can use the `filter` operator to create separate `Flux` instances for each condition.

```java
Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 10);

Flux<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.filter(n -> n % 2 == 0);
Flux<Integer> oddNumbers = numbers.filter(n -> n % 2 != 0);

evenNumbers.subscribe(n -> System.out.println("Even: " + n));
oddNumbers.subscribe(n -> System.out.println("Odd: " + n));
```

Output:
```
Even: 2
Even: 4
Even: 6
Even: 8
Even: 10
Odd: 1
Odd: 3
Odd: 5
Odd: 7
Odd: 9
```

### 5. **Using `scan`**

The `scan` operator can be used to accumulate values and create new streams based on the accumulated results. This is less common for splitting but can be useful in some scenarios.

```java
Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 10);

numbers.scan(new ArrayList<Integer>(), (list, number) -> {
    list.add(number);
    if (list.size() == 3) {
        System.out.println("Chunk: " + list);
        return new ArrayList<>();
    }
    return list;
}).subscribe();
```

Output:
```
Chunk: [1, 2, 3]
Chunk: [4, 5, 6]
Chunk: [7, 8, 9]
Chunk: [10]
```

### Summary

- **`window`** and **`buffer`**: Useful for chunking the `Flux` into smaller collections.
- **`groupBy`**: Splits the `Flux` into multiple `Flux` based on a key.
- **`filter`**: Creates multiple `Flux` based on condition checks.
- **`scan`**: Allows you to accumulate items and potentially split them based on custom logic.

By using these operators, you can manage and manipulate reactive streams effectively without relying on `flatMap`.
