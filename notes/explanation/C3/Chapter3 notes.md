It looks like you're diving deep into filtering and manipulating sequences in Project Reactor with `Flux` and `Mono`. Here’s a concise overview of the various operations you mentioned, organized by their purpose:

### Filtering a Sequence

1. **Basic Filtering**:
    - **`filter`**: Filters items based on a predicate.
    - **`filterWhen`**: Filters items based on an asynchronous condition.

2. **Type Restriction**:
    - **`ofType`**: Restricts emitted items to a specific type.

3. **Ignoring Values**:
    - **`ignoreElements`**: Ignores all values, completing without emitting any.

4. **Removing Duplicates**:
    - **`distinct`**: Removes duplicates in the whole sequence.
    - **`distinctUntilChanged`**: Removes duplicates that are immediately repeated.

### Taking Elements

1. **Taking a Fixed Number**:
    - **`take(long n)`**: Takes the first N elements.
    - **`take(Duration duration)`**: Takes elements for a specific duration.
    - **`next()`**: Takes only the first element, returning a `Mono`.

2. **Taking from the End**:
    - **`takeLast(long n)`**: Takes the last N elements.

3. **Condition-Based Taking**:
    - **`takeUntil(predicate)`**: Takes elements until a condition is met.
    - **`takeWhile(predicate)`**: Takes elements while a condition is met.

4. **Specific Element Position**:
    - **`elementAt(index)`**: Takes an element at a specific index.

### Skipping Elements

1. **Skipping a Fixed Number**:
    - **`skip(long n)`**: Skips the first N elements.

2. **Skipping Based on Duration**:
    - **`skip(Duration duration)`**: Skips elements for a specific duration.

3. **Condition-Based Skipping**:
    - **`skipUntil(predicate)`**: Skips elements until a condition is met.
    - **`skipWhile(predicate)`**: Skips elements while a condition is met.

### Sampling Items

1. **Time-Based Sampling**:
    - **`sample(Duration duration)`**: Samples elements based on time.
    - **`sampleFirst(Duration duration)`**: Samples but keeps the first element in the sampling window.

2. **Publisher-Based Sampling**:
    - **`sample(Publisher)`**: Samples based on a companion publisher.
    - **`sampleTimeout(Publisher)`**: Samples based on a timing publisher.

### Expecting a Single Element

1. **Single Element Expectation**:
    - **`single()`**: Expects exactly one element, errors if more than one.
    - **`single(T defaultValue)`**: Expects one element or returns a default value if empty.
    - **`singleOrEmpty()`**: Accepts empty sequences.

### Example Usage

Here’s a brief example demonstrating some of these operators:

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public class ReactorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flux<Integer> numbers = Flux.range(1, 10)
            .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0) // Filter even numbers
            .distinctUntilChanged()   // Ignore immediate duplicates
            .take(3)                  // Take first 3 even numbers
            .skip(1);                 // Skip the first taken number

        numbers.subscribe(System.out::println); // Output: 4, 6
    }
}
```
